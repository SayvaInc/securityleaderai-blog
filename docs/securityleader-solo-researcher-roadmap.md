# SecurityLeader.ai — Solo Researcher Roadmap
## UX & Content Enhancement Plan for CSO-Level Stakeholders

**Researcher:** Gurvinder Singh
**Platform:** SecurityLeader.ai (Next.js / Vercel)
**GitHub:** GeeksikhSecurity
**Context:** Applied security research, spare-time operation
**Benchmark Inspiration:** Trail of Bits Blog (team of 100+)
**Date:** February 8, 2026

> the UX work below — a factual error, an overclaimed security guarantee, an
> accessibility bug, and one already-fixed issue (PR #2) sitting unmerged for
> ~87 days. See `docs/content-corrections-roadmap-2026-09-15.md`. Evidence
> corrections and Panjabi usability first; visual polish second.

## Guiding Principle

Trail of Bits is a full security consultancy with 100+ engineers, a dedicated marketing team, and 258 open-source repositories built over 14 years. SecurityLeader.ai is one researcher with deep expertise, two active repos, and evenings and weekends.

The goal isn't to replicate Trail of Bits. The goal is to adopt the UX patterns that make their research credible to CSOs, adapted for a solo researcher model. Many of their most effective design decisions are low-effort, high-signal choices that work just as well for an individual.

**The Solo Researcher Advantage:** CSOs are increasingly skeptical of vendor-backed content. An independent researcher with working tools, published findings, and no product to sell carries a different kind of credibility — the kind that gets forwarded in Slack channels with "worth reading" attached.

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 Weekends)
*Highest credibility impact per hour invested*

### 1.1 Add Executive Summary to Existing Articles
**Effort:** ~30 min per article
**Impact:** CSOs can scan your work in 10 seconds and decide to deep-dive

Add a highlighted callout box at the top of each blog post:

```
Executive Summary
─────────────────
[3 lines: What was found, who's affected, what to do about it]
```

Apply to:
- Enhancing GitHub Security Scanning
- OAuth Supply-Chain Heist
- MCP Sentinel Scanner Architecture

### 1.2 Add "Board Talking Points" to Each Article
**Effort:** ~15 min per article
**Impact:** Makes your content directly usable in CISO → Board communication

At the bottom of each article, add 3 bullets framed as:
```
What to tell your board:
• [Risk statement with number]
• [Action your org should take]
• [Timeline or urgency signal]
```

This single addition transforms practitioner content into executive-ready material.

### 1.3 Sharpen Content Type Badges
**Effort:** ~1 hour (CSS changes)
**Impact:** Instant visual credibility — different content types look intentionally different

Current badges ("Research Paper", "Tool / Framework", "Insight") all look the same. Give each a distinct visual weight:

- **Research Paper** → Dark navy badge, serif font
- **Tool Release** → Terminal green badge, monospace font
- **Advisory / Disclosure** → Amber/red severity badge
- **Executive Brief** → Minimal, large type, gold accent

### 1.4 Add PDF Download Button
**Effort:** ~30 min
**Impact:** CSOs share PDFs internally more than links

Even a simple "Print to PDF" trigger or a `@media print` stylesheet gives CSOs a way to share your work in the format their organizations consume. Can use `react-to-print` or browser-native print styling.

---

## Phase 2: Credibility Infrastructure (2-3 Weekends)
*Build the pages that make a solo researcher look institutional*

### 2.1 Create an "About / Research" Page
**Effort:** ~2 hours
**Impact:** Answers the CSO's first question: "Who is this person and why should I trust them?"

Not a résumé. A research credentials page:

```
Gurvinder Singh
Principal Security Researcher

20+ years enterprise security | CISSP | CISA

Active Research
───────────────
• OAuth Supply Chain Security — Analysis of UNC6395 campaign
  affecting 700+ Salesforce environments
• MCP Security — Seven-layer detection pipeline achieving
  95% detection rate, 0% false positives
• AI Code Security — Arcanum taxonomy integration for
  DevSecOps pipelines

Open Source
───────────
• MCP Sentinel Scanner [GitHub stats]
• Unified Security Scanner [GitHub stats]

Published / Referenced
──────────────────────
• [Any Security.com credits]
• [Any community presentations]
• [NotebookLM/podcast content]
```

Keep it factual and sparse. The less it says, the more it signals confidence.

### 2.2 Create a "/tools" Landing Page
**Effort:** ~2 hours
**Impact:** Separates your operational tools from your commentary — CSOs trust people who build things

One page, two tool cards:

```
MCP Sentinel Scanner
────────────────────
Seven-layer detection pipeline for AI agent security
95% detection rate | 0% false positives | 1,400 files/sec
Python | MIT License
[View on GitHub] [Documentation] [Quick Install]

Unified Security Scanner
────────────────────────
[Description and key metrics]
[View on GitHub] [Documentation]
```

Include a one-line install command for each. The presence of a terminal command signals "this is real software" to technical evaluators on a CSO's team.

### 2.3 Typography Refresh
**Effort:** ~1-2 hours
**Impact:** Subtle but significant — signals "research publication" vs. "SaaS landing page"

Changes:
- Headlines: Switch to a serif font (Source Serif Pro, Newsreader, or Literata — all free on Google Fonts). Serif headlines are the single strongest visual signal for "published research."
- Body: Keep sans-serif but consider IBM Plex Sans or DM Sans over Inter/system fonts
- Code blocks: Proper syntax highlighting with a dark theme
- Add horizontal rules between sections (academic paper convention)

### 2.4 Add Email Signup (Minimal)
**Effort:** ~1 hour
**Impact:** Builds an audience you own, outside of social platform algorithms

One line in the footer or end of each article:
```
Monthly Security Brief — one email, executive format.
[email input] [Subscribe]
```

Use Vercel's form handling, Buttondown, or even a simple Google Form. Don't overthink it. The goal is to capture the 5% of CSOs who want to hear from you again.

---

## Phase 3: Content Strategy Additions (Month 2-3)
*New content formats optimized for the CSO audience*

### 3.1 Monthly "Executive Brief" Format
**Effort:** ~2 hours/month
**Impact:** Creates a recurring touchpoint with CSO-level readers

A new content type — 500 words maximum, no code, pure business risk language:
- "February 2026: What Your Board Needs to Know About AI Security"
- Cover 3-4 developments, each in 2-3 sentences
- Close with "Actions for this month"
- Designed for the CISO who has 3 minutes between meetings

This is content Trail of Bits doesn't produce. It's your competitive gap.

### 3.2 Add an "/advisories" Page
**Effort:** ~1 hour to create, ongoing to populate
**Impact:** The existence of this page signals operational research, even with 1-2 entries

Every credible security researcher has an advisory/disclosure page. Start with:
- OAuth supply chain findings
- Any MCP-specific vulnerability patterns documented
- Even "security observations" count — they don't need to be formal CVEs

Format each as:
```
[Date] | [Severity] | [Title]
Affected: [Products/Versions]
Description: [2 sentences]
Recommendation: [1 sentence]
Reference: [Link to full article]
```

### 3.3 Publish a Research Methodology Page
**Effort:** ~1 hour
**Impact:** Answers "how does this researcher work?" — differentiates from opinion bloggers

A short page explaining your approach:
- Tools used (Semgrep, TruffleHog, CodeQL, custom scanners)
- Research process (discovery → validation → documentation → tool development)
- Responsible disclosure philosophy
- How findings feed into open-source tool development

This is a Trail of Bits pattern (they publish their Testing Handbook). Yours can be a single page.

---

## Phase 4: Design Refinements (Month 3+)
*Polish that compounds over time*

### 4.1 Article Page Redesign
Restructure blog post layout:
```
[Content Type Badge] [Severity if applicable]
Title
Author • Date • Read Time
────────────────────────
Executive Summary (highlighted)
────────────────────────
Table of Contents (sticky on desktop)
────────────────────────
Body
────────────────────────
Board Talking Points
Related Tools
────────────────────────
Author line (one sentence, institutional)
Related Research
```

### 4.2 Homepage Hero Refinement
Replace generic "Advanced Security Research & Insights" with a rotating latest-finding format:
```
[LATEST] OAuth Supply-Chain Vulnerability — 700+ Organizations Affected
Analysis and detection framework published →
```

This says "something is happening and this researcher is on it" — the Trail of Bits pattern adapted for a solo operation.

### 4.3 Dark Mode Refinement
CSOs and security practitioners overwhelmingly prefer dark themes (occupational habit). Ensure dark mode is polished, not just inverted. Dark navy (#0A1628) with amber (#D4A843) accents reads as authoritative.

### 4.4 GitHub Stats Integration
For tool pages, pull live data from GitHub API:
```
Stars: XX | Forks: XX | Last Commit: X days ago
```

This signals "active and maintained" without you needing to update it manually.

## What NOT to Do (Scope Discipline)

As a solo researcher with limited time, avoid these time sinks that don't move the needle for CSO credibility:

- ❌ Building a podcast infrastructure (use NotebookLM audio overviews instead — you're already doing this)
- ❌ Creating a newsletter with complex automation (simple monthly email is enough)
- ❌ Chasing conference speaking slots before your content library is deep enough
- ❌ Adding community features, comments, or forums to the site
- ❌ Creating elaborate animations or interactive visualizations
- ❌ Rewriting existing articles — add the executive summary layer on top, don't redo the body
- ❌ Comparing yourself to Trail of Bits in positioning — your frame is "independent researcher" which carries its own credibility

---

## Success Signals (3-Month Check)

You'll know this is working when:

- Articles get shared in security Slack channels and LinkedIn with commentary (not just likes)
- CSOs or security leaders reach out via email or LinkedIn citing a specific article
- GitHub repos see increased stars/forks from people outside your immediate network
- The "Executive Brief" format gets forwarded — check if referral traffic to the site increases
- Someone references your OAuth or MCP research in their own published work
- Consulting inquiries come through SayvaInc.com from readers of SecurityLeader.ai
