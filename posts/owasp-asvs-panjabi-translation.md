# Why I'm Translating OWASP's Security Standard Into Panjabi — And Why It Matters

*What happens when 130 million speakers can finally read the security requirements their applications need to meet?*

> **Executive Summary:** The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) 5.0 — the global benchmark for application security requirements — now has its first-ever Panjabi translation underway, and the first translation into any South Asian language. Using a bilingual English/Gurmukhi format with a 70-term security glossary, this open-source project (PR #3254) makes 350 security requirements accessible to Panjabi-speaking developers and security professionals worldwide. Eight chapters are complete and bilingual; two more are in progress. Reviewers needed — no GitHub experience required.

There are over 130 million Panjabi speakers worldwide. Until now, none of them could read the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard in their own language.

That changes with [PR #3254](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/pull/3254).

## The Gap Nobody Talks About

OWASP ASVS 5.0 is the gold standard for application security requirements — 350 requirements across 17 chapters that architects, developers, and security teams use to build and verify secure software. It's been translated into Turkish, Russian, French, Korean, Spanish, and Chinese.

But not into Panjabi. As of this writing, no completed ASVS translation exists in any South Asian language — not Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Tamil, or Panjabi.

This isn't just a language gap. It's a security gap. Panjabi-speaking developers across India, Pakistan, Canada, the UK, and the US are building applications that serve millions. They deserve security guidance they can read without a language barrier sitting between them and the requirements they need to implement.

## What Makes This Translation Different

Most translations replace English with the target language entirely. I took a different approach: every section is **bilingual**. English first, Panjabi immediately below.

Here's why. Security terminology is precise. "Authentication" and "authorization" are not interchangeable, and neither are their Panjabi equivalents. A bilingual format lets a developer read the Panjabi for comprehension and cross-reference the English for technical precision. No ambiguity. No guessing.

```

Notice the Gurmukhi numerals — ੪.੦ instead of 4.0 — in that early draft. The community review settled this one the other way: the corpus now uses Western digits for versions, years, and quantities (5.0, not ੫.੦), matching how Punjabi University, Patiala writes modern technical text. Gurmukhi numerals are reserved for traditional contexts. That reversal is the point of reviewing in public — details like this get decided by the readers, not the translator.

## The Terminology Problem (And How We Solved It)

How do you translate "SQL Injection" into Panjabi? You don't — at least not entirely. Security has its own lingua franca, and forcing every term into translation creates more confusion than clarity.

We built a glossary of 100+ security terms, each classified into one of four categories:

| Category | When to Use | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Translated (T)** | Concept has a natural Panjabi equivalent | Authentication → ਪ੍ਰਮਾਣੀਕਰਨ |
| **Loan Word (L)** | Term is universally used in English | API → ਏ.ਪੀ.ਆਈ. |
| **Retained (R)** | Acronym or proper noun | OWASP, SQL, XSS |
| **Hybrid (H)** | Part translates, part stays | SQL Injection → SQL ਇੰਜੈਕਸ਼ਨ |

This T/L/R/H system came from spending real time with the source material and asking a practical question: if a Panjabi-speaking developer reads this term in a code review, which version will they actually recognize?

The answer varies by term, and that's the point. "Verification" becomes ਤਸਦੀਕ (tasdīq) because Panjabi has a rich word for it. "CSRF" stays as CSRF because no translation improves on the acronym every developer already knows.

## Complete Security Terminology Glossary

## Why "Panjabi" and Not "Punjabi"

A deliberate choice. "Panjabi" follows the romanization used by [Sikhri.org](https://sikhri.org), the [Panjab Digital Library](http://www.panjabdigilib.org/), and academic institutions that work with Gurmukhi text. "Punjab" is an anglicization; "Panjab" and "Panjabi" are closer to the original ਪੰਜਾਬੀ pronunciation. Since this project is fundamentally about linguistic authenticity, the spelling should reflect that.

For terminology validation, we cross-reference against the *Punjabi University English-Punjabi Dictionary* (ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਯੂਨੀਵਰਸਿਟੀ ਅੰਗਰੇਜ਼ੀ-ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਕੋਸ਼), published by Punjabi University Patiala — first edition 1968, with subsequent editions through 2002 (ISBN 81-7380-095-2). This is the authoritative English-to-Panjabi reference work, and its entries for terms like "authentication" (ਪ੍ਰਮਾਣੀਕਰਨ, ਤਸਦੀਕ), "authorization" (ਅਧਿਕਾਰ ਸੌਂਪਣ ਦਾ ਕਾਰਜ), "access" (ਪਹੁੰਚ, ਰਸਾਈ, ਪਰਵੇਸ਼), and "implement" (ਅਮਲ ਵਿਚ ਲਿਆਉਣਾ, ਪੂਰਾ ਕਰਨਾ) directly informed our glossary choices.

A major inspiration for this glossary work is Sikhri's [Guru Granth Sahib Dictionary](https://gurugranthsahibdictionary.io/). The [Guru Granth Sahib](https://gurugranthsahib.io/info/english/guru-granth-sahib) is the eternal Guru and the supreme guiding authority for Sikhs — containing the divine utterances of six Gurus, three Sikhs, fifteen saints representing various religious traditions, and eleven poets from the Gurus' courts, all written in Gurmukhi, a script institutionalized by Guru Angad Sahib. Sikhri's dictionary project makes this sacred Gurmukhi text searchable, accessible, and precise for a global audience. Their approach to preserving linguistic authenticity while building for digital usability directly influenced how we structured our security terminology glossary. If the Guru Granth Sahib can be made digitally accessible with this level of care and reverence, a modern security standard certainly deserves the same intentionality.

## What's Done, What's Next

As of this update (22 August 2026), **fifteen of the standard's twenty-seven files are bilingual** — every chapter from the title page through V9, plus V12 — and the work is live in [PR #3254](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/pull/3254). Each one is readable on the [Review Hub](/blog/asvs-panjabi-review-hub) without a GitHub account.

**Bilingual (15):**

- Title Page, Introduction, What is the ASVS?, Assessment & Certification, Changes from v4.x
- V1 Encoding and Sanitization · V2 Validation and Business Logic · V3 Web Frontend Security · V4 API and Web Service
- V5 File Handling · V6 Authentication · V7 Session Management · V8 Authorization · V9 Self-contained Tokens · V12 Secure Communication

**Still to come:** V10 OAuth and OIDC, V11 Cryptography, V13 Configuration, V14 Data Protection, V15 Secure Coding and Architecture, V16 Security Logging and Error Handling, V17 WebRTC, then the appendices, final checks, and a community review window.

**Supporting material:** a 70-term security glossary with Gurmukhi translations and IAST romanization, a translation-rules file encoding the Gurmat language constraints and dictionary-lookup order, a reviewer-notes briefing, and an open-questions log tracking every deferred terminology decision (now seventeen entries).

### Built for review, in the open

Every chapter passes two gates before it is published. A mechanical check enforces script purity, sentence-end orthography, Western digits, locked terminology, and completeness — every requirement must appear in both languages with the same identifier and level. Then a second, independent reader compares the English and Panjabi clause by clause. That second pass has found a real meaning error in every chapter so far — most often a hard "must not" softened to "should not", or a technical verb mistranslated — which is exactly why it is not optional for a security standard. What remains are genuine translation-judgment calls that *need human eyes*, which is why the review pages exist.

The structural question — dual-block (English first, complete Panjabi mirror below) versus a compact code-switched style — has been decided in favour of dual-block for the whole corpus, so every sentence can be cross-checked. The earliest chapters written in the code-switched style have been retranslated to match. The remaining terminology questions live in the [open-questions log](https://github.com/GeeksikhSecurity/ASVS/blob/panjabi-translation-v5/5.0/pa-IN/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md).

## The Bigger Picture: Digital Seva

In Sikh philosophy, *seva* means selfless service. Digital Seva is the same principle applied to technology — the idea that technical knowledge shouldn't be gatekept behind language barriers, institutional access, or cultural assumptions about who "belongs" in security.

This translation is one piece of a larger effort to make security knowledge genuinely accessible. Not "accessible" in the way a 40-page English PDF is technically available to download anywhere in the world. Accessible in the way that a Panjabi-speaking developer anywhere in the world can read a security requirement in their own script and immediately understand what their code needs to do.

## Help Review This Translation

I need reviewers, and I've made it as easy as possible — **no GitHub account or PR experience required**.

### Option 1: Email Me Directly (Easiest)

See a term that should be translated differently? Spot a Gurmukhi error? Just email **gurvinder@securityleader.ai** with the subject line **"ASVS Panjabi Review"**. Even a one-line note like *"I think ਕਮਜ਼ੋਰੀ works better as ਖ਼ਾਮੀ for Vulnerability"* is valuable.

### Option 2: GitHub PR Review (For the Git-comfortable)

Open [PR #3254](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/pull/3254), click "Files changed," and leave inline comments on any file in `5.0/pa-IN/`. Start with the [reviewer-notes briefing](https://github.com/GeeksikhSecurity/ASVS/blob/panjabi-translation-v5/5.0/pa-IN/REVIEWER-NOTES.md) — it tells you which chapters are ready, what to look for, and where the open decisions are.

### What Reviewers Should Focus On

You don't need to be both a Panjabi speaker AND a security expert — either qualification helps:

- **Panjabi speakers**: Does the translation read naturally, or does it feel like a forced word-for-word conversion? Are there better Gurmukhi equivalents for any term?
- **Security researchers**: Is the English source meaning preserved? Do any translations introduce ambiguity that could affect a developer's implementation?
- **Gurmukhi linguists**: Any Devanagari script contamination? Proper vowel signs (ਮਾਤਰਾ)? Clean Unicode?

### Open Terminology Questions

These specific terms need community input:

| English | Current Choice | Alternative | Your Preference? |
|---------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Verification | ਤਸਦੀਕ (tasdīq) | ਪੜਤਾਲ (paṛtāl) | ? |
| Requirement | ਲੋੜ (loṛ) | ਸ਼ਰਤ (shart) | ? |
| Vulnerability | ਕਮਜ਼ੋਰੀ (kamzorī) | ਖ਼ਾਮੀ (khāmī) | ? |
| Threat Modeling | ਖ਼ਤਰਾ ਮਾਡਲਿੰਗ | ਖ਼ਤਰਾ ਨਮੂਨਾਕਰਨ | ? |
| Compliance | ਪਾਲਣਾ (pālṇā) | ਅਨੁਪਾਲਣ (anupālaṇ) | ? |
| Implementation | ਲਾਗੂਕਰਨ (lāgūkaraṇ) | ਅਮਲ (amal) / ਕਾਰਜ ਰੂਪ ਦੇਣਾ | ? |

## What This Means for Security

Every language a security standard is translated into expands the pool of people who can build secure software. That's not a nice-to-have — it's a force multiplier. The next critical vulnerability might be found by a Panjabi-speaking developer who could finally read the ASVS requirement that told them what to look for.

Security knowledge should be accessible to all.

*ਸੁਰੱਖਿਆ ਗਿਆਨ ਸਭ ਲਈ ਹੋਣਾ ਚਾਹੀਦਾ ਹੈ.*

## Your Next Move

- **Security leaders:** Share this with Panjabi-speaking team members or forward the glossary to your localization team as a model for multilingual security documentation.
- **Panjabi-speaking professionals:** Email gurvinder@securityleader.ai with "ASVS Panjabi Review" in the subject — even one term correction makes a difference.
- **OWASP community members:** Review [PR #3254](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/pull/3254) and leave inline comments. The full translation — all seventeen security-requirement chapters (V1–V17), the introductory chapters, and all five appendices — is now bilingual and ready for review.

## Board Talking Points

- OWASP ASVS 5.0 is the industry standard for application security verification — used by enterprises globally for compliance and secure development.
- This is the first translation into any South Asian language, reaching 130M+ Panjabi speakers across India, Pakistan, Canada, the UK, the US, and diaspora tech communities worldwide.
- Bilingual format preserves technical precision while removing the language barrier — a model for expanding security literacy beyond English-dominant markets.
- Translation follows a structured QA process with terminology validation, peer review plans, and bilingual consistency checks — demonstrating that localization itself can follow security best practices.
